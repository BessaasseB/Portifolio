# Portifolio
 My personal portifolio
 I'm starting to learn web development, and this is one of the projects i'm using to study.
 Things that i'll be eventually updating:<br>
    The color palette<br>
    The projects section (just need some project)<br>
    Link my github and my linkedIn page to the nav bar<br>
    Link my resumee to the nav bar<br>
    Think about and update some of the texts<br>
