# Portifolio
 My personal portifolio
 I'm starting to learn web development, and this is one of the projects i'm using to study.
 Things that i'll be eventually updating:
    The color palette
    The projects section (just need some project)
    Link my github and my linkedIn page to the nav bar
    Link my resumee to the nav bar
    Think about and update some of the texts
